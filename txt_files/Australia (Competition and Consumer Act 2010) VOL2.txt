Section 10.01

Part X—International liner cargo shipping
Division 1—Preliminary
10.01 Objects of Part
(1) The principal objects of this Part are:
(a) to ensure that Australian exporters have continued access to
outwards liner cargo shipping services of adequate frequency
and reliability at freight rates that are internationally
competitive; and
(b) to promote conditions in the international liner cargo
shipping industry that encourage stable access to export
markets for exporters in all States and Territories; and
(c) to ensure that efficient Australian flag shipping is not
unreasonably hindered from normal commercial participation
in any outwards liner cargo shipping trade; and
(d) as far as practicable, to extend to Australian importers in each
State and Territory the protection given by this Part to
Australian exporters.
(2) It is the intention of the Parliament that the principal objects of this
Part should be achieved:
(a) by permitting continued conference operations while
enhancing the competitive environment for international liner
cargo shipping services through the provision of adequate
and appropriate safeguards against abuse of conference
power, particularly by:
(i) enacting additional restrictive trade practice provisions
applying to ocean carriers;
(ii) requiring conference agreements to meet certain
minimum standards;
(iii) making conference agreements generally publicly
available;

Part X International liner cargo shipping
Division 1 Preliminary

Section 10.01A
(iv) permitting only partial and conditional exemption from
restrictive trade practice prohibitions; and
(v) requiring conferences to take part in negotiations with
representative shipper bodies;
(b) through increased reliance on private commercial and legal
processes and a reduced level of government regulation of
routine commercial matters; and
(c) by the exercise of jurisdiction, consistent with international
law:
(i) over ocean carriers who have a substantial connection
with Australia because they provide international liner
cargo shipping services; and
(ii) to enable remedies for contravention of the provisions
of this Part to be enforced within Australia.

10.01A Simplified outline
The following is a simplified outline of this Part:

•

This Part sets up a system for regulating international liner
cargo shipping services.

•

The main components of that system are as follows:

•

2
Compilation No. 132

(a)

registration of conference agreements;

(b)

regulation of non-conference ocean carriers with
substantial market power;

(c)

regulation of unfair pricing practices;

(d)

Preliminary Division 1

Section 10.02

•

If the conference agreement is registered, the parties will be
given partial and conditional exemptions from:
(a)

sections 45AF, 45AG, 45AJ and 45AK (cartel
conduct); and

(b)

section 45 (contracts etc. that restrict dealings or
affect competition); and

(c)

section 47 (exclusive dealing).

•

The parties to a registered conference agreement are required
to negotiate with, and provide information to, representative
shipper bodies.

•

The Commission may investigate whether grounds exist for
the Minister to deregister a conference agreement.

•

The main ground for deregistration is a breach by the parties
to the agreement of requirements imposed on them by this
Part.

limits occupational liability arising under a law of the State or
Territory.
(2) However, the professional standards law applies for that purpose:

regulations at the time (the contravention time) of the
contravention; and
(b) as if the scheme were in force under that law at the
contravention time, in the form the scheme would have been

(i) the scheme had not been amended or revoked under that
law since the scheme was first prescribed; and
(ii) any additions, omissions, substitutions and other
modifications prescribed by the regulations at the
contravention time had been made to the scheme.

(a) a carrier; or
(b) a carriage service provider;
is said to engage in anti-competitive conduct for the purposes of
this Part.
(2) A carrier or carriage service provider engages in anti-competitive
conduct if the carrier or carriage service provider:
(a) has a substantial degree of power in a telecommunications
market; and

152BDA Restrictions on binding rules of conduct
(1) The Commission must not make binding rules of conduct that
would have any of the following effects:
(a) preventing a service provider who already has access to the
declared service from obtaining a sufficient amount of the
service to be able to meet the service provider’s reasonably
anticipated requirements, measured at the time when the
access seeker made a request in relation to the service under
section 152AR or 152AXB;
(b) preventing a carrier or carriage service provider from
obtaining a sufficient amount of the service to be able to
meet the carrier’s or provider’s reasonably anticipated
requirements, measured at the time when the access seeker
made a request in relation to the service under section 152AR
or 152AXB;
(c) preventing a person from obtaining, by the exercise of a
pre-rules right, a sufficient level of access to the declared
service to be able to meet the person’s actual requirements;
(d) depriving any person of a protected contractual right;
(e) resulting in an access seeker becoming the owner (or one of
the owners) of any part of a facility without the consent of
the owner of the facility;
(f) requiring a person (other than an access seeker) to bear an
unreasonable amount of the costs of:
(i) extending or enhancing the capability of a facility; or
(ii) maintaining extensions to or enhancements of the
capability of a facility;
(g) requiring a carrier or carriage service provider to provide an
access seeker with access to a declared service if there are
reasonable grounds to believe that:
(i) the access seeker would fail, to a material extent, to
comply with the terms and conditions on which the
carrier or provider provides, or is reasonably likely to
provide, that access; or

access, to protect the integrity of a telecommunications
network or to protect the safety of individuals working
on, or using services supplied by means of, a

(b) repeated failures by the access seeker to comply with the
terms and conditions on which the same or similar access has

(b) preventing an NBN corporation from giving a refusal that is
authorised under subsection 151DA(3) for the purposes of

(4) If the Commission makes binding rules of conduct that have the
effect of depriving a person (the second person) of a pre-rules right
to require the carrier or provider to provide access to the declared
service to the second person, the rules must also require the access
seeker:
(a) to pay to the second person such amount (if any) as the
Commission considers is fair compensation for the
deprivation; and
(b) to reimburse the carrier or provider and the Commonwealth
for any compensation that the carrier or provider or the
Commonwealth agrees, or is required by a court order, to pay
to the second person as compensation for the deprivation.
(4A) The Commission must not make binding rules of conduct that:
(a) relate to any or all of the category B standard access
obligations applicable to an NBN corporation; and
(b) have the effect (whether direct or indirect) of discriminating
between access seekers.
Note:

For explanatory material, see section 152CJH.

seeker if the Commission has reasonable grounds to believe that
the access seeker would fail, to a material extent, to comply with
the terms and conditions on which the NBN corporation complies,
or on which the NBN corporation is reasonably likely to comply,
with the relevant obligation.
(4C) Examples of grounds for believing as mentioned in subsection (4B)

185 Merger clearances and authorisations
Existing old law merger clearances and authorisations to be
treated as new law merger authorisations
(1) A clearance or authorisation granted under former Division 3 of
Part VII that was in force immediately before the commencement
time continues in force (and may be dealt with) at and after the
commencement time as if:
(a) it were an authorisation granted under section 88 of the
amended Act; and
(b) it specified section 50.
Old law continues to apply to applications for merger clearances
and authorisations pending at commencement
(2) Despite the repeal of Subdivisions A and B of Division 3 of
Part VII by Schedule 9 to the amending Act, those Subdivisions
(other than sections 95AH, 95AI, 95AR and 95AS) continue to
apply at and after the commencement time, as if the repeal had not
happened, in relation to an application for a clearance made under
section 95AD before the commencement time, unless:
(a) a determination was made before the commencement time
under section 95AM refusing to grant the clearance; or
(b) the clearance came into force before the commencement
time.
Note:

If a clearance is granted in relation to the application, it is taken to be
an authorisation under section 88 that specifies section 50: see
subsections (6) and (7).

(3) Despite the repeal of Subdivisions A and C of Division 3 of
Part VII by Schedule 9 to the amending Act, those Subdivisions
(other than sections 95AZ, 95AZA, 95AZL and 95AZM) continue
to apply at and after the commencement time, as if the repeal had
not happened, in relation to an application:
(a) made under section 95AU before the commencement time;

(b) in relation to which a determination under section 95AZG
had not been made before the commencement time.
Note:

If an authorisation is granted in relation to the application, it is taken
to be an authorisation under section 88 that specifies section 50: see
subsection (6).

New law generally applies for review of merger clearance
determinations
(4) At and after the commencement time, Part IX as amended by
Schedule 9 to the amending Act applies in relation to a
determination (a clearance determination) made by the
Commission before, at or after the commencement time under
former section 95AM in relation to a clearance, as if the clearance
determination related to a merger authorisation that is not an
overseas merger authorisation.
Note:

Former section 95AM is repealed by Schedule 9 to the amending Act,
but has a continued limited application: see subsection (2).

Old law continues to apply to review of merger clearance
determinations if proceedings are pending at commencement
(5) However, if:
(a) an application for a review of a clearance determination is
made under former Division 3 of Part IX before the
commencement time; and
(b) the Tribunal has not made its decision on the review before
the commencement time;
then:
(c) subsection (4) does not apply in relation to the clearance
determination; and
(d) despite the repeal of that Division by Schedule 9 to the
amending Act, that Division continues to apply in relation to
the clearance determination at and after the commencement
time, as if the repeal had not happened.
