(1) If a third party is unable to agree with the provider on one or more
aspects of access to a declared service, either the provider or the
third party may notify the Commission in writing that an access
dispute exists, but only to the extent that those aspects of access are
not the subject of an access undertaking that is in operation in
relation to the service.
Note:

An example of one of the things on which a provider and third party
might disagree is whether a previous determination ought to be varied.

(1) The Commission must not make a determination that would have
any of the following effects:
(a) preventing an existing user obtaining a sufficient amount of
the service to be able to meet the user’s reasonably
anticipated requirements, measured at the time when the
dispute was notified;
(b) preventing a person from obtaining, by the exercise of a
pre-notification right, a sufficient amount of the service to be
able to meet the person’s actual requirements;
(c) depriving any person of a protected contractual right;
(d) resulting in the third party becoming the owner (or one of the
owners) of any part of the facility, or of extensions of the
facility (including expansions of the capacity of the facility
and expansions of the geographical reach of the facility),
without the consent of the provider;
(e) requiring the provider to bear some or all of the costs of
extending the facility (including expanding the capacity of
the facility and expanding the geographical reach of the
facility);
(ea) requiring the provider to bear some or all of the costs of
maintaining extensions of the facility (including expansions
of the capacity of the facility and expansions of the
geographical reach of the facility);

(3) A determination is of no effect if it is made in contravention of
subsection (1).
(4) If the Commission makes a determination that has the effect of
depriving a person (the second person) of a pre-notification right
to require the provider to supply the service to the second person,
the determination must also require the third party:
(a) to pay to the second person such amount (if any) as the
Commission considers is fair compensation for the
deprivation; and
(b) to reimburse the provider and the Commonwealth for any
compensation that the provider or the Commonwealth agrees,
or is required by a court order, to pay to the second party as
compensation for the deprivation.
Note:

Without infringing paragraph (1)(b), a determination may deprive a
second person of the right to be supplied with an amount of service
equal to the difference between the total amount of service the person
was entitled to under a pre-notification right and the amount that the
person actually needs to meet his or her actual requirements.

(4A) If an application for review of a declaration of a service has been
made under subsection 44K(1), the Commission must not make a
determination in relation to the service until the Tribunal has made

service or services that is at least sufficient to meet the
efficient costs of providing access to the regulated
service or services; and

regulatory and commercial risks involved; and
(b) that the access price structures should:
(i) allow multi-part pricing and price discrimination when
it aids efficiency; and
(ii) not allow a vertically integrated access provider to set
terms and conditions that discriminate in favour of its
downstream operations, except to the extent that the
cost of providing access to other operators is higher; and
(c) that access pricing regimes should provide incentives to
reduce costs or otherwise improve productivity.

(2) Subsection (1) does not authorise the conferral of a function or
power, or the imposition of a duty, by a law of a State or Territory
to the extent to which:
(a) the conferral or imposition, or the authorisation, would
contravene any constitutional doctrines restricting the duties
that may be imposed on the Commission or Tribunal; or
(b) the authorisation would otherwise exceed the legislative
power of the Commonwealth.
(3) The Commission or Tribunal cannot perform a duty or function, or
exercise a power, under a State or Territory access regime law
unless the conferral of the function or power, or the imposition of
the duty, is in accordance with an agreement between the
Commonwealth and the State or Territory concerned.

Section 44ZZMAA
44ZZMAA No merits review by Tribunal of decisions under energy
laws
(1) This section applies if a State/Territory energy law or the
Australian Energy Market Act 2004 purports to confer a function
or power, or to impose a duty, in relation to a decision made under:
(a) a State/Territory energy law; or
(b) a uniform energy law applied as a law of the Commonwealth
under the Australian Energy Market Act 2004.
However, this section does not apply in relation to a decision
relating to the disclosure of confidential or protected information
under such a law.
(2) The purported conferral or imposition has no effect to the extent to
which it would require or permit merits review (however
described) of the decision by the Tribunal.
(3) This section applies despite anything in any law of the
Commonwealth, a State or a Territory.

44ZZMA How duty is imposed
Application
(1) This section applies if a State or Territory access regime law
purports to impose a duty on the Commission or Tribunal.
Note 1:

Section 44ZZMB sets out when such a law imposes a duty on the
Commission or Tribunal.

Note 2:

Section 320 of the South Australian Energy Retail Legislation, as it
applies as a law of a State or Territory, deals with the case where a
duty purportedly imposed on a Commonwealth body under that
applied law cannot be imposed by the State or Territory or the
Commonwealth due to constitutional doctrines restricting such duties.

State or Territory legislative power sufficient to support duty
(2) The duty is taken not to be imposed by this Act (or any other law
of the Commonwealth) to the extent to which:

Section 44ZZMB
(a) imposing the duty is within the legislative powers of the State
or Territory concerned; and
(b) imposing the duty by the law of the State or Territory is
consistent with the constitutional doctrines restricting the
duties that may be imposed on the Commission or Tribunal.
Note:

If this subsection applies, the duty will be taken to be imposed by
force of the law of the State or Territory (the Commonwealth having
consented under section 44ZZM to the imposition of the duty by that
law).

Commonwealth legislative power sufficient to support duty but
State or Territory legislative powers are not
(3) If, to ensure the validity of the purported imposition of the duty, it
is necessary that the duty be imposed by a law of the
Commonwealth (rather than by the law of the State or Territory),
the duty is taken to be imposed by this Act to the extent necessary
to ensure that validity.
(4) If, because of subsection (3), this Act is taken to impose the duty, it
is the intention of the Parliament to rely on all powers available to
it under the Constitution to support the imposition of the duty by
this Act.
(5) The duty is taken to be imposed by this Act in accordance with
subsection (3) only to the extent to which imposing the duty:
(a) is within the legislative powers of the Commonwealth; and
(b) is consistent with the constitutional doctrines restricting the
duties that may be imposed on the Commission or Tribunal.
(6) Subsections (1) to (5) do not limit section 44ZZM.

44ZZMB When a law of a State or Territory imposes a duty
For the purposes of sections 44ZZM and 44ZZMA, a State or
Territory access regime law imposes a duty on the Commission or
Tribunal if:
(a) the law confers a function or power on the Commission or
Tribunal; and

the Commonwealth must pay that person:
(c) a reasonable amount of compensation agreed on between the

Meaning of industrial action—basic definition
(4) In subsection (3), industrial action means:
(a) the performance of work in a manner different from that in
which it is customarily performed, or the adoption of a
practice in relation to work, the result of which is a restriction
or limitation on, or a delay in, the performance of the work,
where:
(i) the terms and conditions of the work are prescribed,
wholly or partly, by a workplace instrument or an order
of an industrial body; or
(ii) the work is performed, or the practice is adopted, in
connection with an industrial dispute; or
(b) a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of work, or
on acceptance of or offering for work, in accordance with the
terms and conditions prescribed by a workplace instrument or
by an order of an industrial body; or
(c) a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of work, or
on acceptance of or offering for work, that is adopted in
connection with an industrial dispute; or
(d) a failure or refusal by persons to attend for work or a failure
or refusal to perform any work at all by persons who attend
for work.
For this purpose, industrial body and workplace instrument have
the same meanings as in the Fair Work Act 2009.
Meaning of industrial action—further clarification
(5) For the purposes of subsection (3):
(a) conduct is capable of constituting industrial action even if the
conduct relates to part only of the duties that persons are
required to perform in the course of their employment; and

(1) A designated sector means a sector of the Australian economy
designated under subsection (2).
(2) The Minister may, by legislative instrument, designate a sector of
the Australian economy by specifying:
(a) classes of information (the designated information); and
(b) persons who hold one or more specified classes of the
designated information (or on whose behalf such information
is held); and
(c) the earliest day (the earliest holding day) applicable to the
sector for holding the designated information; and
(d) each of the classes of information within the designated
information for which a person may charge a fee if:
(i) the person is required under the consumer data rules to
disclose information within that class to another person
in specified circumstances; or
(ii) another person uses information within that class in
specified circumstances as the result of a disclosure

(iii) a designated gateway for CDR data;
to do or not to do specified things when acting on behalf of
the CDR entity and within the agent’s actual or apparent
authority;
(j) rules about any other matters that the provisions of this Part
provide may be specified, or otherwise dealt with, in the
consumer data rules.

56BK Further limitations on the consumer data rules
(1) The consumer data rules cannot impose on a person a requirement
that has a retrospective commencement or application.
Example: The rules cannot require a data holder to disclose CDR data on a day
before the rules are registered, or on a day before the registration of a
variation to the rules that includes the requirement.
Note:

Other limitations on the consumer data rules are in sections 56BD,
56BF and 56BG.

(2) To avoid doubt, the consumer data rules may require a person to do
something on a particular day, in relation to CDR data generated or
collected on an earlier day, if the person:
(a) is a data holder of the CDR data; or
(b) is an accredited person; or
(c) is a person who has given a valid request under the consumer
data rules relating to the CDR data; or
(d) is a designated gateway for the CDR data.
Example: A data holder is given a valid request to disclose CDR data that was
generated before the rules are registered. The rules can require that
disclosure.

Division 5 Privacy safeguards

Section 56EA

Division 5—Privacy safeguards
Subdivision A—Preliminary
56EA Simplified outline
This Division sets out privacy safeguards that protect the privacy
or confidentiality of CDR consumers’ CDR data, whether the CDR
consumers are individuals or bodies corporate.
The privacy safeguards apply mainly to accredited persons, but
also to data holders and designated gateways, in relation to their
handling or future handling of the CDR data.
A person’s failure to comply with any of these safeguards may lead
to consequences, including liability to a civil penalty (see
Subdivision G) or the suspension or revocation of the person’s
accreditation (see subsection 56BH(3)).

56EB Kinds of CDR data to which the privacy safeguards apply
(1) The privacy safeguards only apply to CDR data for which there are
one or more CDR consumers.
Note:

One requirement for CDR data to have a CDR consumer is that there
needs to be at least one person who is identifiable, or reasonably
identifiable, from the CDR data or from related information (see
paragraph 56AI(3)(c)).

(2) The privacy safeguards apply to CDR data whether the CDR data
is true or not.

56EC Relationship with other laws
Relationship with the consumer data rules
(1) If there is an inconsistency between the privacy safeguards and the
consumer data rules, those safeguards prevail over those rules to
the extent of the inconsistency.
(2) However, the consumer data rules are taken to be consistent with
the privacy safeguards to the extent that they are capable of
operating concurrently.
Note:

This means that the privacy safeguards do not cover the field that they
deal with.

Relationship with the Privacy Act 1988
(3) This Division does not limit Part IIIA (about credit reporting) of
the Privacy Act 1988. However, the regulations may declare that in
specified circumstances that Part applies in relation to CDR data as
if specified provisions of that Part were omitted, modified or varied
as specified in the declaration.
(4) Despite the Privacy Act 1988:
(a) the Australian Privacy Principles do not apply to an
accredited data recipient of CDR data in relation to the CDR
data; and
(aa) if section 56ED, 56EE, 56EF or 56EG applies to an
accredited person in relation to CDR data—the
corresponding Australian Privacy Principle does not apply to
the accredited person in relation to the CDR data; and
(b) if subsection 56EN(1) applies to a disclosure of CDR data by
a data holder of the CDR data—Australian Privacy
Principle 10 does not apply to the data holder in relation to
that disclosure of the CDR data; and
(c) if subsection 56EP(1) applies to CDR data and a data holder
of the CDR data—Australian Privacy Principle 13 does not
apply to the data holder in relation to the CDR data; and

Note 1:

For the accredited data recipient, the privacy safeguards will apply
instead.

Note 2:

Section 56EN (or privacy safeguard 11) is about the quality of CDR
data. Section 56EP (or privacy safeguard 13) is about correcting CDR
data.

(5) Apart from paragraphs (4)(aa) to (d), this Division does not affect
how the Australian Privacy Principles apply to:
(aa) an accredited person who does not become an accredited data
recipient of the CDR data; or
(a) a data holder of CDR data in relation to the CDR data; or
(b) a designated gateway for CDR data in relation to the CDR
data.
Note 1:

Privacy safeguard 1 will apply to a data holder or designated gateway
in parallel to Australian Privacy Principle 1.

Note 2:

The consumer data rules (which are made under Division 2) will
affect how the Australian Privacy Principles apply. Requirements and
authorisations under those rules will be requirements or authorisations
under an Australian law for the purposes of the Australian Privacy
Principles.

(a) criminal proceedings are started or have already been started
against the person for an offence; and
(b) the offence is constituted by conduct that is substantially the
same as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention.
The proceedings for the pecuniary penalty order may be resumed if
the person is not convicted of the offence. Otherwise, the
proceedings are dismissed.
(4) Criminal proceedings may be started against a person for conduct
that is substantially the same as conduct constituting a

92 regardless of whether a pecuniary penalty order has been made
against the person in respect of the contravention.
(5) Evidence of information given, or evidence of production of

the order was made); and
(b) the conduct alleged to constitute the offence is substantially
the same as the conduct that was claimed to constitute the
contravention.
However, this does not apply to a criminal proceeding in respect of
the falsity of the evidence given by the individual in the
proceedings for the pecuniary penalty order.

87CF Contribution not recoverable from defendant
A defendant against whom judgment is given under this Part as a
concurrent wrongdoer in relation to an apportionable claim:
(a) cannot be required to contribute to any damages or
contribution recovered from another concurrent wrongdoer in
respect of the apportionable claim (whether or not the
damages or contribution are recovered in the same
proceedings in which judgment is given against the
defendant); and
(b) cannot be required to indemnify any such wrongdoer.

87CG Subsequent actions
(1) In relation to an apportionable claim, nothing in this Part or any
other law prevents a plaintiff who has previously recovered
judgment against a concurrent wrongdoer for an apportionable part
of any damage or loss from bringing another action against any
other concurrent wrongdoer for that damage or loss.
(2) However, in any proceedings in respect of any such action, the
plaintiff cannot recover an amount of damages that, having regard
to any damages previously recovered by the plaintiff in respect of
the damage or loss, would result in the plaintiff receiving
compensation for damage or loss that is greater than the damage or
loss actually sustained by the plaintiff.

87CH Joining non-party concurrent wrongdoer in the action
(1) The court may give leave for any one or more persons to be joined
as defendants in proceedings involving an apportionable claim.
