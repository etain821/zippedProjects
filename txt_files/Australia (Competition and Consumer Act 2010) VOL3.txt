to hold out the first person to the public as the manufacturer
of the goods;
(e) a person who imports goods into Australia if:
(i) the person is not the manufacturer of the goods; and
(ii) at the time of the importation, the manufacturer of the
goods does not have a place of business in Australia.
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1)(c):
(a) a name, brand or mark is taken to be applied to goods if:
(i) it is woven in, impressed on, worked into or annexed or
affixed to the goods; or
(ii) it is applied to a covering, label, reel or thing in or with
which the goods are supplied; and
(b) if the name of a person, a name by which a person carries on
business or a brand or mark of a person is applied to goods, it
is presumed, unless the contrary is established, that the
person caused or permitted the name, brand or mark to be
applied to the goods.
(3) If goods are imported into Australia on behalf of a person, the
person is taken, for the purposes of paragraph (1)(e), to have
imported the goods into Australia.

(c) the use of any mark in relation to them; and
(d) any instructions for, or warnings with respect to, doing, or
refraining from doing, anything with or in relation to them;
and
(e) what might reasonably be expected to be done with or in
relation to them; and
(f) the time when they were supplied by their manufacturer.
(3) An inference that goods have a safety defect is not to be made only
because of the fact that, after they were supplied by their
manufacturer, safer goods of the same kind were supplied.
(4) An inference that goods have a safety defect is not to be made only
because:
(a) there was compliance with a Commonwealth mandatory
standard for them; and
(b) that standard was not the safest possible standard having
regard to the latest state of scientific or technical knowledge
when they were supplied by their manufacturer.

10 Asserting a right to payment
(1) A person is taken to assert a right to payment from another person
if the person:
(a) makes a demand for the payment or asserts a present or
prospective right to the payment; or
(b) threatens to bring any legal proceedings with a view to
obtaining the payment; or
(c) places or causes to be placed the name of the other person on
a list of defaulters or debtors, or threatens to do so, with a
view to obtaining the payment; or
(d) invokes or causes to be invoked any other collection
procedure, or threatens to do so, with a view to obtaining the
payment; or
(e) sends any invoice or other document that:

Unfair contract terms Part 2-3

Section 24
24 Meaning of unfair
(1) A term of a consumer contract or small business contract is unfair
if:
(a) it would cause a significant imbalance in the parties’ rights
and obligations arising under the contract; and
(b) it is not reasonably necessary in order to protect the
legitimate interests of the party who would be advantaged by
the term; and
(c) it would cause detriment (whether financial or otherwise) to a
party if it were to be applied or relied on.
(2) In determining whether a term of a contract is unfair under
subsection (1), a court may take into account such matters as it
thinks relevant, but must take into account the following:
(a) the extent to which the term is transparent;
(b) the contract as a whole.
(3) A term is transparent if the term is:
(a) expressed in reasonably plain language; and
(b) legible; and
(c) presented clearly; and
(d) readily available to any party affected by the term.
(4) For the purposes of subsection (1)(b), a term of a contract is
presumed not to be reasonably necessary in order to protect the
legitimate interests of the party who would be advantaged by the
term, unless that party proves otherwise.

25 Examples of unfair terms
Without limiting section 24, the following are examples of the
kinds of terms of a consumer contract or small business contract
that may be unfair:

characteristics:
(a) to take part in the scheme, some or all new participants must
provide, to another participant or participants in the scheme,
either of the following (a participation payment):
(i) a financial or non-financial benefit to, or for the benefit
of, the other participant or participants;
(ii) a financial or non-financial benefit partly to, or for the

benefit of, new participants and partly to, or for the
benefit of, other persons.
(2) A new participant includes a person who has applied, or been
invited, to participate in the scheme.
(3) A scheme may be a pyramid scheme:

participants; and
(c) no matter who is to make introductions to the scheme of
further new participants.
(4) A scheme may be a pyramid scheme even if it has any or all of the
following characteristics:
(a) the participation payments may (or must) be made after the
new participants begin to take part in the scheme;
(b) making a participation payment is not the only requirement
for taking part in the scheme;
(c) the holding out of the prospect of entitlement to recruitment
payments does not give any new participant a legally
enforceable right;

which the goods are mounted for display or exposed for
supply; or
(c) that is determined on the basis of anything encoded on or in
relation to the goods; or

available to the public if:
(i) a time is specified in the catalogue as the time after
which the goods will not be sold at that price and that
time has not passed; or
(ii) in any other case—the catalogue may reasonably be
regarded as not out-of-date; or

Example 1: An airline advertises a flight for sale. Persons have the option of
paying for a carbon offset. If the carbon offset is preselected on the
airline’s online booking system, the single price for the flight must
include the carbon offset charge. This is because the person has not, at
or before the time of the representation, deselected the charge on the
online booking site. If the person deselects the optional carbon offset
charge later in the online booking process, the single price does not
need to include the carbon offset charge after the charge is deselected
because of the exception provided by paragraphs (a)(i) and (ii).
Example 2: The GST may be an example of an amount covered by paragraph (b).
Example 3: The passenger movement charge imposed under the Passenger
Movement Charge Act 1978 may be an example of an amount covered

Division 2—Unsolicited consumer agreements
Subdivision A—Introduction
69 Meaning of unsolicited consumer agreement
(1) An agreement is an unsolicited consumer agreement if:
(a) it is for the supply, in trade or commerce, of goods or
services to a consumer; and
(b) it is made as a result of negotiations between a dealer and the
consumer:
(i) in each other’s presence at a place other than the
business or trade premises of the supplier of the goods
or services; or
(ii) by telephone;
whether or not they are the only negotiations that precede the
making of the agreement; and
(c) the consumer did not invite the dealer to come to that place,
or to make a telephone call, for the purposes of entering into
negotiations relating to the supply of those goods or services
(whether or not the consumer made such an invitation in
relation to a different supply); and
(d) the total price paid or payable by the consumer under the
agreement:
(i) is not ascertainable at the time the agreement is made;
or
(ii) if it is ascertainable at that time—is more than $100 or
such other amount prescribed by the regulations.
(1AA) To avoid doubt, a place mentioned in subsection (1)(b)(i) may be a
public place, and need not be a place the dealer cannot enter
without the consumer’s consent or invitation.

Section 70
(1A) The consumer is not taken, for the purposes of subsection (1)(c), to
have invited the dealer to come to that place, or to make a

predominant purpose of entering into negotiations relating to
the supply of the goods or services referred to in
subsection (1)(c); or
(b) contacted the dealer in connection with an unsuccessful
attempt by the dealer to contact the consumer.
(2) An invitation merely to quote a price for a supply is not taken, for
the purposes of subsection (1)(c), to be an invitation to enter into
negotiations for a supply.
(3) An agreement is also an unsolicited consumer agreement if it is an
agreement of a kind that the regulations provide are unsolicited
consumer agreements.
(4) However, despite subsections (1) and (3), an agreement is not an
unsolicited consumer agreement if it is an agreement of a kind
that the regulations provide are not unsolicited consumer
agreements.

(b) no other party to the proceeding proves that the agreement is
not an unsolicited consumer agreement.

(1) A court must not make an order under section 224 against a person
in relation to either of the following matters (a consumer
protection breach):
(a) a contravention of a provision referred to in
section 224(1)(a);
(b) conduct referred to in section 224(1)(b), (c), (d), (e) or (f)
that relates to a contravention of such a provision;
if the person has been convicted of an offence constituted by
conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct constituting
the consumer protection breach.
(2) Proceedings for an order under section 224 against a person in
relation to a consumer protection breach are stayed if:
(a) criminal proceedings are started or have already been started
against the person for an offence; and
(b) the offence is constituted by conduct that is substantially the
same as the conduct alleged to constitute the consumer
protection breach.
The proceedings for the order may be resumed if the person is not
convicted of the offence. Otherwise, the proceedings are dismissed.
(3) Criminal proceedings may be started against a person for conduct
that is substantially the same as conduct constituting a consumer
protection breach regardless of whether an order under section 224
has been made against the person in respect of the breach.
(4) Evidence of information given, or evidence of the production of
documents, by an individual is not admissible in criminal
proceedings against the individual if:
(a) the individual previously gave the evidence or produced the
documents in proceedings for an order under section 224
against the individual in relation to a consumer protection
breach (whether or not the order was made); and
(b) the conduct alleged to constitute the offence is substantially
the same as the conduct that was claimed to constitute the
consumer protection breach.

have:
(a) engaged in conduct in contravention of a provision referred
to in subsection (1)(a) of that section; or
(b) engaged in conduct referred to in subsection (1)(b), (c), (d),
(e) or (f) of that section that relates to a contravention of such
a provision;
but that the person acted honestly and reasonably and, having
regard to all the circumstances of the case, ought fairly to be
excused, the court may relieve the person either wholly or partly
from liability to a pecuniary penalty under that section.

227 Preference must be given to compensation for victims
If a court considers that:
(a) it is appropriate to order a person (the defendant) to pay a
pecuniary penalty under section 224 in relation to:
(i) a contravention of a provision referred to in
subsection (1)(a) of that section; or
(ii) conduct referred to in subsection (1)(b), (c), (d), (e) or
(f) of that section that relates to a contravention such a
provision; and
(b) it is appropriate to order the defendant to pay compensation
to a person who has suffered loss or damage as result of that
contravention or conduct; and
(c) the defendant does not have sufficient financial resources to
pay both the pecuniary penalty and the compensation;
the court must give preference to making an order for
compensation.

reasonable to expect the relevant failure to comply with a
guarantee referred to in section 259(1)(b) to become apparent
having regard to:
(a) the type of goods; and
(b) the use to which a consumer is likely to put them; and
